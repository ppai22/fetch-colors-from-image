# fetch-colors-from-image
Mini-project that runs a Python script to generate a list of major colours in the input image file. Uses Open-CV and the concept of K-Means clustering.

# Dependencies:
Python version: 3.7.4
Python modules: Open CV, pandas, Sci Kit Learn, math
colors.csv file generated using the wonderful project developed by ...
Input image to be in JPEG format (as of now)

# Further improvements
- Try to use separate K-Means clustering code to remove dependency over sklearn
- Expand the colors.csv look-up table to include more colours although it works okay as of now
- Try to optimize the code
